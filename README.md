Assignment 5
All the tests ran on my local machine.


To Run code:

1. make clean
2. make all
3. make run

to run different thread cases you need to change the global for the amount of threads

# int numThreads = 1;

Then all you do is run

# make clean; make all; make run

for each thread [1,2,4,8] that you want to run.
